\subsection*{Motivation} 
\vspace{-0.2cm}
By measuring the speed of seismic waves propagating in the Earth's near surface, we can image the top tens to hundreds of meters of the subsurface, with deeper features being resolved by lower frequencies. These seismic velocity images can be interpreted to evaluate earthquake or landslide risk, to detect permafrost, to find sinkholes or tunnels, or to track near surface changes related to drilling activities. Additionally, in cases of complex near-surface conditions, accurate near-surface images can be used to improve deeper seismic images.
\par
By cross-correlating noise recorded at any two receivers in an array, we can extract signals mimicking an active seismic survey with a source at any receiver, virtual source response functions \cite{Lobkis2001}, \cite{Lin2008}, \cite{Wapenaar2010A}, \cite{Wapenaar2010B}. Thus, when active sources are too costly or logistically prohibitive, passive seismic can be a good option for near surface imaging. However, the theory is limited by the assumption of homogeneous uncorrelated sources \cite{Wapenaar2010A}. Non-ideal sources can cause artifacts in extracted velocities, but with careful processing experts can overcome these limitations \cite{Bensen2007}, \cite{Daskalakis2016}, \cite{Zhan2013}, even for anthropogenic sources occurring at higher frequencies \cite{Girard2016}, \cite{Martin2015}, \cite{Martin2016}, \cite{Nakata2011}, \cite{Nakata2015}, \cite{Zeng2017}. Acquisition is a further issue: nearly all of the past ambient noise studies on dense arrays have been temporary arrays which were labor-intensive to install and maintain \cite{Lin2008}, \cite{Nakata2011}, \cite{Nakata2015}, \cite{Zeng2017}. 
\par
Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) probes a fiber optic cable with a laser interrogator unit (IU) to repurpose that fiber as a series of strain or strain rate sensors. For cost reasons, most experiments use straight fibers, but these fibers measure strain along the axis of the fiber, so some experimenters are now wrapping the fiber in a helix \cite{Kuvshinov2016}. DAS is being increasingly adopted in the energy industry for microseismic monitoring \cite{Webster2013} and time-lapse seismic surveys \cite{Daley2013}, \cite{Mateeva2014}, \cite{Bakku2015}, \cite{Miller2016} because it allows for a dense series of seismic sensors to communicate over long distances while they are run by a single power source, and those sensors can be permanently left in the same location.
\par
The maintenance cost of permanent node arrays motivated the use of buried DAS, and there have now been several ambient noise experiments where fiber optics were buried in shallow trenches so the fiber was directly coupled to the ground \cite{AjoFranklin2015}, \cite{Martin2015}, \cite{Martin2016}, \cite{Zeng2017}. In fact, we can sacrifice some ground-to-sensor coupling in favor of easier installation by running fibers in existing telecommunications conduits \cite{Martin2017}. By running fibers in existing conduits, or even plugging into existing dark fiber, on-demand repeatable seismic studies in urban areas requiring little manual labor will soon be a reality. When the interrogator unit probes a fiber, the data can serve many purposes: near surface imaging with ambient noise, earthquake detection and location (and local site response) \cite{Martin2017}, tracking vehicle traffic, potentially even detecting underground tunneling, studying the status of fluid pump systems nearby, or detecting intrusion into manholes. 
\par
With ambient noise data becoming increasingly easy to record, we can only extract its full value if we further automate the processing workflow.

\vspace{-0.5cm}
\subsection*{Significance} 
\vspace{-0.2cm}
This manuscript will walk through the basics and some new tools for processing ambient noise for near-surface seismic imaging. Its purposes: (1) overview of ambient noise processing for statisticians or mathematicians to encourage them to develop data analysis tools or theory for working with non-ideal ambient noise, (2) show optical engineers an application where an optical measurement device's noise level and sensitivity should be improved, and (3) expose gepohysicists to an emerging acquisition method and a few machine learning tools and metrics to quantify processing decisions, a task that will become increasingly more difficult as data acquisition becomes easier and cheaper.
\par 
It is hard to build intuition about amibent noise processing without looking at real data, so we will present this tutorial in the context of a case study: a figure-eight-shaped array of 2.4 km of fiber optics lying loosely in existing telecommunications conduits underneath the Stanford University campus. This particular experiment is ideal because it demonstrates the wide variety of issues on the near horizon as we push for broader use of ambient noise. 
\par
We will discuss the noise level and sensitivities particular to recording with DAS, and a novel deployment that can greatly reduce costs (increasing data volumes): fiber loosely laying in existing telecommunications conduits. The array detects a wide variety of seismic noise sources that do not conform to the ideals of existing ambient noise theory: it sits in a seismically active region, 20 km from the Pacific ocean, 7 km from the San Francisco bay, with major highways on either side, a variety of roads with differing levels of traffic near the fiber, regular quarry blasts within 15 km, plumbing and HVAC systems throughout the site, multiple construction sites near the array, and foot and bicycle traffic throughout. With over 600 sensors continuously recording 50 samples per second since September 2016, manual inspection of most data is infeasible, making the automation tools shown in this paper critical to extracting subsurface information from these data.

	\item Abstract/summary
	\vspace{-0.3cm}
	\item Introduction: (i) why care about near surface imaging, (ii) tradeoffs of sensor quality with cost and array density (DAS or MEMS \cite{Evans2014}, etc...), (iii) introduce idea of ambient noise to get rid of active sources, (iv) today dense data acquisition over longer periods of time (potentially continuous streaming) is becoming easy, so we must further automate ambient noise processing 
	\vspace{-0.8cm}
	\item Related work
		\begin{enumerate}

		\item Examples of how machine learning techniques have improved accuracy and sped up processing in other passive seismic applications \cite{Fisher2016}, \cite{Yoon2015}
		\end{enumerate}
	\vspace{-0.4cm}
	\item Data Processing: we process the noise we record so that it mimicks data that would be recorded if the noise field followed theoretical ideals \cite{Bensen2007}
		\begin{enumerate}
		\vspace{-0.3cm}
		\item New: clustering/separation of data (k-means, hierarchical agglomerative, SVM separation) \cite{Liao2005}, \cite{Hastie2009} to speed up noise field exploration, identification of potential issues
		\vspace{-0.1cm}
		\item Existing tool: STA/LTA \cite{Withers1998} in time and Fourier domain to detect earthquakes or quarry blasts \cite{Bensen2007}, \cite{Girard2016}, this could potentially be enhanced to detect small events efficiently with template matching and statistical methods \cite{Yoon2015}
		\vspace{-0.1cm}
		\item New: How to use earthquakes to estimate sensor coupling heterogeneity when array installation is relatively uncontrolled (loose fiber laying in a variety of conduits) 
		\vspace{-0.1cm}
		\item New: Automatically detect \& filter persistent noise sources from short time spectra
		\vspace{-0.1cm}
		\item New: Automate the design of f-k domain filters for particular user-selected clusters based on separation from other clusters. In particular, a demonstration of removing vehicle noise: time domain mute vs. manually designed f-k vs. automated design. 
		\vspace{-0.1cm}
		\item New: In the presence of strong sources, cross-coherence (whitening after correlation) has a tendency to work better than cross-correlation in the sense of producing virtual source response estimates with fewer artifacts \cite{Nakata2011}, \cite{Martin2016}. Show metrics to automate choice of cross-correlation or cross-coherence per receiver pair (can change over time).
		\end{enumerate}
	\vspace{-0.5cm}
	\item Measuring improvements: to compare old and new processing methods measure convergence of virtual source response function estimates (both cross-coherence and cross-correlation) as more data is incorporated using the correlation coefficient like \cite{Seats2012}, but use a random sampling scheme over all data so convergence rates have error bars.
	\vspace{-0.3cm}
	\item Show a few dispersion images and a velocity model resulting from surface wave tomography, a couple of the possible uses of the virtual source response estimates
	\vspace{-0.3cm}
	\item Conclusions and future directions
	\end{enumerate}
